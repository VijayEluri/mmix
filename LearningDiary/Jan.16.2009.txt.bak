Hooray of Probablility Theory

There are n coins,  
if you flip the coin, you may get head with probability of $p_j$, get
tail with probablity of $q_j$ for coin $j$;

assuming $p_j+q_j=1$, that means you will not get rings.

The probability of get k heads after fliping those 100 coins is 


p_j+q_{j}Z * 

$$a_0+a_1{k}+a_2{k^2}\cdot a_n{k^n}$$

the probability of get k heads is $a_k$.

The Expectation of k is w, that means averagely you should get w tails.
(The average of k with probablity as weight)

if the $k \le w$, then 
$a_{k-1} < a_k$

if the $k \be w$, then 
$a_{k+1} < a_k$

To prove it, we consider
case 1:
$p_j=p$ and $q_j=q$;ASDFG

so if you have
