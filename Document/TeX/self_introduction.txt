\centerline{\bf Self Introduction}
\bigskip
I am an experienced J2EE software engineer. I want to apply this 
position---JVM Developer, just because I am interested on lower level of System.
I have accumulated enough knowledge about lower level of System, 
such as how the Linux Kernel works. Now I am looking forward to applying my knowledge
in the practice and further improving my skills and knowledge.

The following is my profile against the requirement in the job description.

\medskip
%For the junior members, we are more interested in their potential rather than their specific experience.
%The following are important:
{\it * Ability to learn quickly with an interest in learning new things}\par
I am a quick learner, especially when I am learning the things on which I am 
interested. After I graduated from university, I realized that I am more 
interested on Computer Science than my major, so I self-studied Computer 
Science and successfully become a J2EE software engineer.

\medskip
{\it * Motivation---interest in JVM work and interest in learning new operating 
systems (HPUX and VMS)}\par
Sure, I am interested in how JVM works. I already know how the Linux kernel works,
I want to know how the JVM is implemented on top of the Kernel. It is also good to know more 
kernel such as HPUX and VMS. 

\medskip
{\it * Flexibility and teamwork ¨C interesting and willing to chip in with routine
 tasks to help the team get the overall job done}\par
I am a team player. I have been part-time Server Administrator and Database 
Administrator in the team and has ever supported almost every team member.

%\noindent Desirable skills and experience:\par
\medskip
{\it * JVM experience}\par
I have had a look on the source code of the Hot Spot JVM after Sun open sourced it. 
I have analyzed its build process. Most of the code are written in $C^{++}$, 
but some $C^{++}$ language features like Exception are not used.


\medskip
{\it * Interest in how things work at a lower systems level.}\par
I am interested in things  at a lower systems level. For example,
I am interested in synchronization issues involving multiple threads. In order to 
understand the synchronization, I have to know how it is implemented in 
the hardware level, such as atomic operation and Memory Bus Lock, without
this kind of lower level knowledge, I don't think I really understand how 
synchronization works.

\smallskip          
I am interested in operating systems Kernel, I have read ``Understanding Linux Kernel'', 
``Linux Kernel Scenario Analysis'', and ``Linux Kernel Development'' many times to 
understand how Linux works.
memory management subsystem is one of the most complex component of the Kernel. 
I know the structure of virtual memory management quite well.

  {\it * Very good written/verbal English communication skills}\par
I have worked in a Software Outsourcing company for more than 4 years. I need to 
communicate with our customer though email every day, through conference call
every week. Also internally we communicate in English. I am confident on my 
written/verbal English communication skills.

{\it    * Excellent problem solving skills}\par
I have solved many technical issues in development and produciton environment.
E.g. the performance tuning experience mentioned in my resume.

{\it    * Significant C programming experience}\par
C language is not hard for me, especially I think the pointer is not a
chanllenge even when I fisrt time encounter it.

{\it * Java or C++ programming}\par
I have more than 6 year Java Programming experience. I also know C++ language, 
but do not have much hands on exeprience.

{\it * J2EE ¨C sometimes useful but less important than the above}\par
I have more than 5 years experience on J2EE.
\medskip
%{\it * Knowledge of object oriented concepts (most people have from school)}\par
%Yes. I have a lot of experience not only on basic object oriented concepts, 
%but also on OOAD and design patterns.
