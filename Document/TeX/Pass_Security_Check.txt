\beginsection 1. Background introduction
    
In recent years, getting throug the security check at the airport has become a chore. 
In some cities, the whole process
can takes 15-20 minutes or more, this includes standing in line, 
sending you bag through X-ray machine, and walking through the mental detector, which detects or finds
find any mental you might have hidden on your body. 
Most security check thus require passengers to take metal items out of their pockets, and put tem on a tray (little flat
container ) and send through the X-ray machine. In some countries, notably the U.S., 
they even insist that passengers remove their coats and shoes. 

And of course, not just airport that have high security, more and more tourist attraction are beefing up 
(increasing) their security too.  So negotiating security check is a good skill to practice.

In this episode, when Honestor and Alan are on the way home, they arrived at the airport late, 
they are axcious for missing their filight. when the 
dailogure begins, they checked in to get their boarding passes.  Now they need to go through the security.

When you listen, try to answer the following quesiton.

1. At the beginning of the dialogure, what does security officer ask the passengers to do?

2. What problem does security find with Alan's bagage?

3. Alan have to laeave a item behind at the security check, what is it?

\beginsection 2. Scenario 1

\userA ``we are cutting kind of close.''

\userB ``Don't worry, the line is short.''

\MO ``Ok everyone, laptop ouf of your bags, put them on the tray.

 coins,  keys, nailfolds, put them on the tray. 

\userA ``Security , sure it is tight,'' 

\userB ``Good thing is I changes my socks.''

\userA ``Damn, I always set off in metal detector.''

\MO ``Please step through again, Sir. Keys, coins, any item in your pocket?''

\userA ``I don't think so. Oh, wait, I got a gum here.''

\MO ``Gum  wrapped in alluminium. That's probably it.''

\userA ``I made it.''

\userB ``Yeah, they should call it dummy detector instead of metal detector.''



I alwasy set up in the metal detecton. that's probably 
dummy detector instead of metal detector.
put them on the tray
 

\beginsection 3. Scenario 2
\noindent
\FO ``Excuse me, whose bag is this?''

\userB ``That's mine, Officer.''

\FO ``Could you pelase open it up for me?''

\userB ``Sure.''

\userB ``I guess I'll just leave it here.''

\userA  ``moisturizing motion''

\userB ``Well, My skin get so dry in the airplane, anyways, what's it matter?''


\beginsection 3. Exam the detail of scenario 1

Alan and Honestor has made trought the security, but not without incident.
Let's examine the detail how they handle the check, how does the dialogue start off.
\medskip
\userA ``we are cutting kind of close.''

\userB ``Don't worry, the line is quite short.''
\medskip
``To cut it close'' means ``to be short on time''. Honestor is worried they might miss the flight.
what are some other idiomatic expressions refer to be in a hurry.

1. we are getting short of time, let is try to keep it up a notch .
 
3. we are really presssed for time, try not to drag your feet.
 
4. we made it with seconds to spare. 

5. We arrive not a moment too soon.

6. We made it just in the nick of the time.
  
7. Take you time, we got a edges.

   ``to be short of time, is same as ``to be pressed for time'', both mean ``to be in a hurry.''
   
``let's kick it upa notch.'' the first to  making a big effort, in this context, it is same as 
``try not to drag your feet'', they both mean ``try to hurry up.''
   
  `` to make it the seconds to spare '' is similar to ``to make it just in the nick of time''
  
both mean  to arrive not a moment too soon, mean to arrive when,  for examle,  a plane is leaving  or a movie is beginning. 
  
  ``take you time'' means ``don't hurry.'' is same as "we got aches",  In another words, we have plenty of time.

  
  
what are actios the officer give the Honestor and Alan as they approach the check.
 \medskip 
  \MO ``Ok everyone, laptop ouf of your bags. put them on the tray.
take you shoes off, coats off, any items in your pocker, please reomve them, coins, keys,nailfolds and put hem on the tray.''

 


\userA ``security , sure it is tight, ''

\userB ``good thing is I chagen my socks.''
  \medskip
\userA and \userB  have to take off their shoes, so when Honestor is glad he is wearing clean socks. said  Noe clean socks. when Alan said security is tight, he means it is strict.
  
 THE OFFICER WILL CHAECK PASSENGER STRICKLY. he is perhaps surprised do you get throught the security withoup problem.
  
 No, of course not, Honestor sets off in the metal detector.
 \medskip 
\userA ``Damn, I always set off in metal detector.''

\MO ``Please step through again, Sir. Keys, coins, any item in your pocket?''

\userA ``I don't think so. Oh, wait, I got a gum here.''

\MO ``Gum  wrapped in alluminium. That's probably it.''
  \medskip
 Honestor almost forget him gum in his pocket, he is perhaps suprise such a small 
 thing  can set off a detector, 
 use such courtesy language can help you go throuth the security
  quickly and smoothly.
  
 But when , Oh, use such courtesy language, let's look at the some phrases we can use
when security officer asked to check again.

 1. Let me see, oops, I almost forget to take off my watch. 
 
 2. I am sorry, it's probably my (belk baco), let me take it off.
 
 3. Sorry about that, I must misses a couple of coins in my pocket. 
  
 4. Silly me, I did not take off my keys. 
 
 What happens next when Honestor step through the metal detector the second time. but Alan can 
 not help teasing him. 
 \medskip
 \userB ``I made it.''

\userA ``Yeah, they should call it dummy detector instead of metal detector.''
 
 \MO ``''
 \medskip
 A dummy is slang for dummy person. Alan said the machine has detected Honextor's gum ,but rather
  it is lack of brains.
 
Now it's goint to be Alan's turn to track attention from secuity




\beginsection 4. Exam the detail of scenario 2

\noindent
\FO ``Excuse me, whose bag is this?''

\userB ``That's mine, Officer.''

\medskip
you should notice despite Alan's surprise. He address the officer politely and properly

Listen again.

\medskip
\FO ``Could you pelase open it up for me?''

\userB ``Sure.''

\FO ``These toilet articles,  should be enclosed in a quarter sized, zip-lockeded bag.''

\userB ``Oh, Sorry, I didn't know.''

\medskip
The security officer is instruct the Alan to mus b epalnce in a quarter-size, zip-locked bug. 
which is small plastic bag,
when security officer
It is important to respond politely. Alan respond " sorrry, I don't know" is both politely and
 honestly.

1. Exexuse me, officer, can I just ask a few question?

2. Officer, do we need to move our shoes as well?

3. I am sorry, I have no idea about that.

4. I forget that was in there, I am sorry.

before they left throught the check, Alan has one more suprise to wait for him.
\medskip
\FO ``Please be more carefull next time. And I am sorry, but this bottle of moisturizing motion is too large.''

\userB ``Oh, Really''

\FO ``You are not allowed to take anything over 3 aunces. Sir.''

\medskip

For your reference, a fluid aunces is about 35 milli-litres, it is good to check each time you travel, the rules change.

 currently allow 3 fluid aunces.

listen again, how Alan response?
\medskip
\userB ``What should I do?''

\FO ``You can return to departure hall or you just leave it here.''

\userB ``I guess I'll just leave it here. ''
\medskip
If security officer inform you some .. can not pass security check, 
do not hesitate to ask for options.
anyting left behind the security  will usually be destroied.
 often, however, where you maybe politly ask you options.
 check into as bagges
 there, you are able to checked in as a gagger.
 
 
 Let's practice polity language to ask for options. 
 
 1. What are my options.?
 
 2. what would you advise doing?
 
 3. Is there any other option?
 
 4. If I take it back to the departrure hall, can I go to the head of the line when I come back?
 

 
 The last phrase may be particularly useful, when you are hurry to catch a plane, many security check will allow 
 you 
 they will not ask you to stand in the line again. may be you have to take some item back to the departure hall.
 
 How does the dialogure finish?
 \medskip
 \userA  ``moisturizing motion, now ''

\userB ``Wow, My skin get so dry in the airplane, anyways, what's it matter?''
 \medskip
 My skin get so dry in airplane, ( make fun of Alan), since Alan have been just teasing him.
