1. Ultra Edit can detect the line break type and provide the option to 
convert it automatically or prompt end user to make a decision.

The menu path Is: 
File Handling -> DOS/UNIX/MAC Handling

Unix/Mac file type detect and conversion
	Disable
	prompt user to change when detecting
	automatically convert to DOS line break.

2. The tricky thing is that by default, after you convert the line break
type, when you save it, the Ultra Edit will save in the original line break
type, so net result is nothing was changed.

The menu path to disable this setting is as follows.
File Handling -> DOS/UNIX/MAC Handling
one option is called "Save the file in input format"

With this knowledge, we should be able to fix the line break issue easily.

3. some tine the line break may be more serious, there is no uniform line break
in the file, then we need to use Regular expression to find/replace.

3.1. need to set perl styple regular expression. the default is Ultra Edit styple
regular expression, which may not be the one you want to use.

Search -> Regular Expression Engine

3.2. for example
replace 
	\r\r
with 	\r\n

then replace 
	\r
with 	\r\n

or do it twice as follows.
repalce \r([^\n])
with	\r\m$1
