\centerline{\bf Self introduction in Architecture Call}

\beginsection 1. First 5 Years
I graduated in 1999, majored in Pharmacy, which is about the mechanism of how the
drug takes effect and how to make the drug. 

I have worked in two pharmacy factories, one for two years, another for 3 years.

On 2004, I got a job as Java Developer in a small company. The project I worked on
is to build a WEB based Office automation system for one department in Government.

On 2005, I join Bleum and at the same year, I got my baby. Now he is more than 4 years old.
he is lovely and full of energy, he bring me a lot of happiness. The only regret is that 
I did not spend enough time with him, instead
