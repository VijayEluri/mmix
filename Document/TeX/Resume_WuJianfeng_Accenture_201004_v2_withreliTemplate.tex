\beginsection{Skills Summary. }\par
I have applied the following J2EE technology in my daily work since 2004: JSP, Servlet, JSTL, JDBC, XML;
and I have 3--5 years experience in using the following frameworks or tools: Struts, Tapestry,
Spring, Hibernate, Cactus, Log4J, Axis, Tibco, JUnit, TextNG, JAXB etc., etc.


I am proficient in using Struts, Spring and Hibernate. I said so because I am able to read its
source code to resolve the tricky issues in the project. For example, I addressed 
one platform dependent Hibernate issue, please refer to my blog at 
http://www.blogjava.net/wueddie/archive/2008/07/07/212999.html

\smallskip
For Application Server, I usually use Tomcat in development environment and use clustered Oracle
Application Server in system testing environment. I am proficient on tomcat and I know know how Tomcat works internally.
I am also IBM certified Solution Developer---WebSphere Studio, V5.0 since October of 2004.


\smallskip
I have systematically studied the Oracle database and became OCP 
(Oracle Certified Professional) on July of 2006. 
I know the Oracle Architecture and its 
internal details, such as Execution plan, Access Path.
With those knowledge, I have succeeded in addressing performance issues in
many WEB applications. 

\smallskip
I not only can read and write technical document fluently in English, 
but also can communicate with native speaker face to face or through 
conference call.
In order to co-develop a project on site, I have ever been to San Francisco 
for one month on March of 2007.

potential credit card holder---high school students or college students. 

Achievement: I lead the team deliver the projects on time and with high quality;
one of the project is customer certified zero-defect project.

We encountered performance issue in the production environment, and we successfully
addressed it from two aspects; one is to tune the SQL statement to ensure the scalability
of application, and another one is to optimize the front end performance by adopting
the best practices recommended by Yahoo.

\smallskip  
\smallskip\noindent
{\sl Architect (Oct. 2007 -- May 2008)}\par
\smallskip
\noindent
I start over sighting all the projects in the ODC(Offshore Development Center).
My major duty includes code review, training, evaluation, technical interview, trouble-shooting,
 technical improvement, and development process improvement. 

During this period, I have introduced GlassFish application server into one project, which 
supports hot deployment and improve the developer's productivity.

the conversion from dynamic JSP content to PDF. 

As the technical leader of this project. My major achievement is
the PDF printing solution based on PD4ML, which is highly appreciated by customer.

\smallskip

In another project, we are required to migrate three back end business procedures

since customer is not satisfied with the performance of the existing system. 
We got following lessons and experience about application performance tuning. 

I am the major developer of this project. I not only improved the performance
of the application (several SQL query speeds up more than ten times after tuning),
but also gain a lot of hands on experience on Oracle database.

\smallskip
\smallskip\noindent
{\sl Software Engineer at Bleum(Dec., 2004 -- Oct., 2005)}\par
\smallskip
\noindent
The architecture of this project is a little special, the business layer is located 
in Tibco Bizwork server, and Application server  basically is a client of the

is to resolve the issues in using Axis; 
I researched on Axis and give training about Axis to team members in the design phase. 



\smallskip
\smallskip\noindent

  and every game can been scored automatically by application. 

\smallskip
\smallskip\noindent
{\sl Go Game (Weiqi) Applet (May 2002 -- Aug. 2002)} 
\smallskip
\noindent
As an ancient Chinese game, Go is very complex. This program can help the
GO players to improve their skills especially skills of surviving 
in the board. With
the correct strategy stored in the data file, the applet, which is
 downloaded from Internet, can fight against the player, and beat him 
 until the player has mastered the skills. This applet improved the 
 interactivity in the teaching and learning of Go related skill.
