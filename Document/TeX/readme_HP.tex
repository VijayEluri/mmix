\beginsection{2. Skills Summary. }\par
I have more than five years working experience in J2EE application development. 
With the solid knowledge of J2EE platform and Oracle database, I am good at performance
tuning of multi-tier enterprise application. My interest on computer science is broad, besides J2EE 
and Oracle database, I also have good understanding of Linux Kernel, Algorithm and 
Data Structure, and Computer Architecture. %, and Regular Expression. 

I have extensive programming experience in Java; besides Java language, I also have hands
on experience in C/C++.
%self-study C/C++ to extends my view, when I study C++, 
%I focus on the reason behind the language design and revolution.

%{bf Java} I am not only good at Java programming, but also familiar with C and C++. 
%I not only have ever read the source code of Struts, Spring and Hibernate etc.,
%but also have ever read the source code of Linux kernel. The kind of background 
%provide me a more practical and pragmatic attitude about technical.

\beginsection{2.1. J2EE Platform. }\par
I have more than five years' experience of developing enterprise application in J2EE platform. 
I have ever applied the following J2EE technology in my daily work since 2004: 
JSP, Servlet, JSTL, JDBC, JTA, etc., and I have 3 -- 5 years experience in using the 
following frameworks and tools: Struts, Tapestry, Hibernate, Spring, Cactus, JUnit,
Log4J, Ant, Axis, Tibco, etc. 

For Application Server, I usually use Tomcat in development environment and
use clustered Oracle 10g Application Server in System Testing environment. 
I am also familiar with WebSphere Application Server; 
I am IBM certified Solution Developer -- WebSphere Studio, V5.0 since October of 2004.

The other tools used in my daily work includes Eclipse, CVS, VSS, Jude.

\beginsection{2.2. Oracle Database. }\par
I believe that solid knowledge of database is
 important in building high-performance J2EE WEB applications. 
After I first time encountered performance issue in my project on 2005 and 
successfully resolve it, I start to learn Oracle Database systematically; 
I become Oracle Certified Professional Database Administrator since July of 2006. 

Since that, I become the authority of Oracle database in my team and company, 
I have solved many application performance issues, most of them are caused 
by bad SQL statement. I conducted the training to share my knowledge on Oracle
with team members, help them understand how a SQL statement is executed by Oracle,
how to read the execution plan, and how to rewrite SQL to performance tune a SQL statement.

\beginsection{2.3. Design Skills. }

I have good understanding of classic GOF Design Patterns and J2EE patterns. 
It helps a lot in understanding the architecture of my projects and other 
frameworks used in projects. 
%But I treat design pattern as a way to help you resvole the problem beautifully

After I mastered design patterns, I also got better understanding of Object Oriented
 Analysis and Design;  
I also like to read source code of famous software and see how design patterns are
used in real software. E.g. I read Sun's javac implementation and see how Visitor
pattern and Interpreter pattern are used. 

    
\beginsection{2.4 Source Code Reading.}\par
I believe Source Code Reading is an important skill for software engineer.
I have ever read the source code of Struts, Hibernate, and Spring etc., 
the knowledge of how those frameworks work internally helps a lot when I trouble-shoot 
the issues happened in development and production environment. 

I am interested in the implementation of Unix/Linux, I have read the Operating 
System related book and know how it works in general, but still feel there 
are too much ambiguity in the description. So I trace down to the source code, and
everything becomes clear and accurate. 

During my study of Linux kernel, I also get familiar with the software development 
in Unix platform, including the GNU tool chain, such as Make and GCC.%, Software installation.

%Another reason I like to read source code is that I am interested in knowing 
%how the things works internally.
%I also spend time to read the MMIX simulator implemented by Knuth, and realize 
%how beautiful and elegant the C code could be.
%The knownledge of how kernel works helps me understand how 
%provide me a more practical and pragmatic attitude about technical.

\beginsection{2.5. English}\par
%I can apply English in daily work fluently as a second language. 
I not only can read and write technical document fluently in English, 
but also can communicate with native speaker face to face or through conference call.

In order to co-develop a project on site, I have ever been to San Francisco 
for one month on March of 2007. Now we communicate with customer major
 through weekly conference call and email.

\beginsection{2.6 Certificates. }

I do not think the Certificate is a good measurement of my capability, but I do think
pursuing a certificate can help me learn the knowledge systematically and quickly.
Here is the certificate I have ever pursued successfully.\par

\beginsection 3. Work Experience\par
\noindent
I started my first full-time IT job from March 15, 2004, till now I have more
than five years experience on J2EE platform. Before that, I have worked in 
Pharmaceutical industry for almost 5 years; during that period, I self-studied 
computer science and apply the technology I learned in part-time projects.

\beginsection 3.1. Shanghai Bleum Inc. (December 2004 -- Now)\par

\noindent
I have worked in Bleum for more than 4 years. I joined Bleum as a software  
engineer, and gradually grow up to senior software engineer, technical leader,
architect, and project leader. 

\smallskip\noindent
\beginsection 3.1.1. Project Leader (May 2008 -- Now)\par
\noindent
I start to take the full responsibility of a project, which is a public website, provide service for 
potential credit card holder --- high school students or college students. 

During the past year, I lead the team deliver the projects on time and with high quality;
one of the project is customer certified zero-defect project.

We encountered performance issue in the production environment, and we successfully
addressed it from two aspects; one is to tune the SQL statement to ensure the scalability
of application, and another one is to optimize the front end performance by adopting
the best practices published by Yahoo.
  
Since the whole team are still junior, I spend many effort to train them on 
technical skills, such as database tuning, and communication skills, such as
how to raise question and write email to customer.

\smallskip\noindent
\beginsection 3.1.2. Architect (October 2007 -- May 2008)\par
\noindent
As an architect, I start oversight all the projects in the ODC(Offshore Development Center).
My major duty include training, evaluation, technical interview, trouble-shooting,
 technical improvement, and development process improvement. 

During this period, I have introduced GlassFish application server into one project, which 
supports hot deployment and improve the developer's productivity. (In that project, Tomcat's
hot deployment feature does not work properly because of some Axis related code.)

%In another project, we have many duplicate environment related Spring configuration file, one for 
%each environment, it is hard to maintain. I suggest customer to use template Spring configuration file
%to keep all the configuration in one file. Customer appreciated it and adopted in the project.

\beginsection 3.1.3. Technical Leader(October 2006 -- October 2007)\par
\noindent
One of project during this period is to add new feature --- PDF printing for a WEB site, and to
change the looking and feel by using more pop up window. The PDF printing 
is a big challenge for us until we found a tool called PD4ML, which supports
the conversion from dynamic JSP content to PDF. We also verified that it can 
works well in the load of about twenty concurrent users. 

As the technical leader of this project. My major achievement is
 the PDF printing solution based on PD4ML, which is highly appreciated by customer.

\smallskip

Another project during this period is to migrate three back end procedures
written in Toplink, those procedure are scheduled to synchronize data between 
different databases everyday. We are required to re-implement
the existing procedure and improve the performance. 

For the convenience of performance tuning, we decide to access database through JDBC.
After we finish the implementation, we measure the performance with JProfiler and identify the
bottle neck. Actually, most of time are spend in data access layer, we tune
the SQL statement and finally improved the performance to be two times better than before
(The back end procedure can finish in half an hour instead of one hour).

As the technical leader of this project. My major responsibility is
designing and performance tuning.

\beginsection 3.1.4. Senior Software Engineer (October 2005 -- October 2006)\par
\noindent
This project is to optimize performance of an existing application, 
since customer is not satisfied with the performance of the existing system. 
We got following lessons and experience about application performance tuning. 

First, we should consider performance requirement and perform load test in construction phase; 
Second, the load test environment should be as close to real production environment as possible,
load test environment should include same amount of data and same amount of concurrent user in database. 
Third, Hibernate may generate some unnecessary table joins, the solution
is to use native SQL instead of HQL in such case. 
Last but not the least, all the SQL Statement, including the SQL statement 
generated by Hibernate, should be reviewed to decide whether existing index 
is enough or not and what new index we need to add. 

I am the major developer of this project. I not only improved the performance
of the application (several SQL query speeds up more than ten times after tuning),
but also gain a lot of hands on experience on Oracle database.

\beginsection 3.1.5. Software Engineer (December, 2004 -- October, 2005)\par
\noindent
The architecture this project is a little special, the business layer is located 
in Tibco Bizwork server, and Application server  basically is a client of the 
web service published by Tibco Bizwork. The major challenge in this project 
is to resolve the issues in using Axis, for example, memory leak issue. 
We also developed a mock mechanism to develop and test WEB layer when the
 business layer is not ready. (Business layer is joint-developed simultaneously 
 by another two teams, one is in America and the other is in Singapore.)

I researched on Axis and give training about Axis to team members in the design phase. 

\beginsection 3.2. Shanghai Zhongxin Development Inc. (March 2004 -- December 2004)\par

\noindent
The application is deployed on Oracle 9i Application Server in the local area net. 
It is used to manage all kind of  registry and approve of Shanghai Production 
Security Administration Bureau. The Project achieved success in the use of Struts 
Framework, which saves us a lot of work. I am in charge of implementing the 
Business Flow module and System Manage module. 

My responsibility includes Designing, Coding, Unit/Integration testing of related module. 

\beginsection 3.3. Shanghai Zhongxi Pharmaceutical Inc. (May 2001 -- March 2004)\par

\noindent
In this period, I worked in Marketing Department providing academic support for new drugs. 
In my non-working time, I continually learning Java programming language 
and other Computer Science subject, and got the certificate of Programmer 
and Advanced Programmer. Then I started to be involved in the following 
IT projects in my leisure time.

\beginsection {3.3.1. Chinese Chess Game On Internet (September 2003 -- November 2003). }

In this project, we need to develop a Chinese Chess Game application 
of Server/Client architecture. Its main features include negotiating 
the regulation, playing between a pairs of player through internet, 
watching other player's game, counting of time, and requesting to regret
 the step taken. The player's information is stored in the databases,
  and every game can been scored automatically by application. 

I am in charge of the design and implementation of the client side, 
implementation of chess rule in the Server side. It took me a lot of 
time to develop the GUI in client side and to integrate it with the
 server side. 

\beginsection {3.3.2. Go Game (Weiqi) Applet (May 2002 -- August 2002). }

As an ancient Chinese game, Go is very complex. This program can help the
GO players to improve their skills especially skills in ``making live'' 
in the board. With
the correct strategy stored in the data file, the applet, which is
 downloaded from Internet, can fight against the player, and beat him 
 unless the player has master the skills. This applet improved the 
 interactivity in the teaching and learning of Go related skill. 

I am in charge of design and implementation of the program by myself. 
I also build a simple  temporary WEB site to test the Applet. 


\beginsection {3.4. Suzhou NO.2 Pharmaceutical Factory (July 1999 -- May 2001)}\par

\noindent
During this period, I worked in R\&D department and took part in the 
developing of a new chemical drug -- Paroxtine. My major responsibility 
includes chemical synthesis and chemical analysis. At the same time, 
I start to self-study Java programming language and other Computer Science subject.
