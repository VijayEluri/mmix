\beginsection 1. Notation.\par
The {\it matrix-chain multiplication problem} can be stated as follows: given 
a chain $<A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n>$ of $n$ matrices, where for $i = 1, 2, ..., n,$ 
matrix $A_i$ has dimension $p_{i-1} * p_i$, fully parenthesize the product 
${A_1 A_2 A_n}$ in a way that minimizes the number of scalar multiplications.

\beginsection 2. Pseudo Code\par
int n;

int [] p = new int[n+1];//A_i
int[][] m = new int[n+1][n+1];//index from 1 to make it simple
int [] s = new int[n+1];

for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
    m[i][i]=0;//for length==1;
}

for(int i=2; i<=n;i++){//loop on length
    for(int j=1; j+i-1<=n;j++){//try different start point
        //range is [j,j+i-1]
        int min=Integer.MAX;
        int temp=0;
        for(int k=j;k<j+i-1;k++){//split after k_th position.
            temp=m[j][k]+m[k+1][j+i-1]+ p[k-1]*p[k]*p[k+1];
            //the length of subproblem are less than i;
            if(temp<min){
                min=temp;
            }
        }
        m[j][j+i-1]=temp;
    }
}

\beginsection Longest Common Subsequence\par

One goal of comparing two strands of DNA is to determine how ``similar''the two 
strands are, as some measure of how closely related the two organisms are. 
Similarity can be and is defined in many different ways. 

For example, we can say that two DNA strands are similar if one is a substring 
of the other. (Chapter 32 explores algorithms to solve this problem.) 
 
In our example, neither S1 nor S2 is a substring of the other. Alternatively, 
we could say that two strands are similar if the number of changes needed to 
turn one into the other is small. (Problem 15-3 looks at this notion.) 
 
Yet another way to measure the similarity of strands S1 and S2 is by finding 
a third strand S3 in which the bases in S3 appear in each of S1 and S2; 
these bases must appear in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively. 
The longer the strand S3 we can find, the more similar S1 and S2 are. 
In our example, the longest strand S3 is GTCGTCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA.
