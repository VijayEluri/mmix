% This test file generates the output shown on the opposite page.
% It's a bit complex because it tries to illustrate lots of stuff.
% TeX ignores commentary (like this) that follows a `%' sign.
% First the standard output style is changed slightly:
\hsize=29pc % The lines in this book are 29 picas wide.
\vsize=42pc % The page body is 42 picas (not counting footlines).
\footline={\tenrm Footline\quad\dotfill\quad Page \folio}
\pageno=1009 % This is the starting page number (don't ask why).
% See Chapter 23 for the way to make other page format changes via
% \hoffset, \voffset, \nopagenumbers, \headline, or \raggedbottom.

\topglue 1in % This makes an inch of blank space (1in=2.54cm).

\beginsection Exercise 2.1.\par
Explain how to type the following sentence to \TeX: Alice said, ``I always use an
en-dash instead of a hyphen when specifying page numbers like `480--491' in a
bibliography.''

\beginsection Exercise 2.2.\par
What do you think happens when you type four hyphens in a row?

\beginsection Exercise 2.4.\par
OK, now you know how to produce {''}' and '\thinspace{''}; how do you get {``}\thinspace` and `{``} ?\par
```\par
{``}`\par
`{``}\par
'''\par
'{''}\par
'\thinspace{''}\par
{''}'\par
{``}\thinspace`I do'\thinspace{''}\par

%|\+|\<text$_1$>|&|\<text$_2$>|&|$\,\cdots\,$|\cr|

\beginsection Exercise 2.5.\par
Why do you think the author introduced the control sequence {\tt \char`\\thinspace} to
solve the adjacent-quotes problem, instead of recommending the trickier construction
{\tt '\$\char`\\,\$''} (which also works)?

'\thinspace'' v.s. '$\,$''

{\tt '\char`\\thinspace''} v.s. {\tt '\$\char`\\,\$''}

Answer: I guess the reason is that author have not introduce Math mode yet so far.

we can get backslash---{\tt \char`\\} by {\tt \char`\\char`\char`\\\char`\\}.

\beginsection Exercise 4.2.\par
{\it Explain how to typeset a {\rm roman} word in the midst of an italicized sentence.}\par
a bold `{\bf f\/}' v.s. a bold `{\bf f}'

\beginsection Exercise 20.3.\par
%Continuing this example, what is the result of {\tt \$\char`\\row\{\char`\\bf x\}\$}	?
\def\row#1{(#1_1,\ldots,#1_n)}
$$\row{x}$$
$$\row{\bf x}$$
$$\row{{\bf x}}$$
