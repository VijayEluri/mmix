To avoid mess up the kernel source tree.
I am using the following command to build the kernel.
	make -j2 O=/tmp
unfortunately everytime when Gentoo is boot up. the /tmp
folder will be wiped up. so the .config is removed. so is the change made in .config.

Try to use a permanent tmp directory to avoid similar problem.
