Initialized empty shared Git repository in /srv/git/eddie.git/

Project eddie successfuly set up.

The push URL for the project is git+ssh://repo.or.cz/srv/git/eddie.git.

You can assign users now (use project name (without .git) as username, admin password as password)
 - don't forget to assign yourself as a user as well if you want to push! Everyone who wants 
 to push must register himself as a user first. (One user can have push access to multiple
  projects and multiple users can have push access to one project.)

Note that you cannot clone an empty repository since it contains no branches;
 you need to make the first push from an existing repository.

You may experience permission problems if you try to push right now. 
If so, that should get fixed automagically in few minutes, please be patient.

Enjoy yourself!

create repo in /home/eddie/C with command
git init
git add .
git commit -a -m " init commit"
(ensure the repo is not too big)

test to clone it to ueddieu home

in order to work around user issue. I create user ueddieu in repo.or.cz with dsa public key.
and chown to ueddieu:eddie.
(it failed when I use sudo, but I succedd later when I use su first and execute chown later on.)



sudo chown also failed, I try su and chown again.

It seems the Arrays.copyOfRange is new API in JDK 1.6. JDK 1.5 will report error when compiling.
so try to download JDK 1.6 for Linux, first choice I make to down load rpm.bin for linux, 
it does not work , so I tried again with another version.
It is not so user friendly for LInux user.

ubuntu is based on Debian. is not suitable to use rpm package.


Hello,

somebody asked for the password for project ueddieu to be reset. Since you are
the project admin, you get to know the new password:

   git+ssh://repo.or.cz/srv/git/ueddieu.git QBCc.hQZZ6.

In case you didn't request the password to be reset, we apologize. Nevertheless,
you have to use the reset password now (possibly to change it back).

Quick-link to the edit project page:

    http://repo.or.cz/m/editproj.cgi?name=ueddieu

Have fun!
