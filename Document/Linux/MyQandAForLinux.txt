There are many questions coming into my mind when I read the Linux kernel book 
and source code. As time goes by, I become more knowledgeable than before and 
can address those quesitons by myself, here is the first question addressed 
by myself.

Q: why kernel have to map the high memory in kernel space, why not just 
allocate the hign memory and only map it in user process.
A: Because kernel also need to access the high memory before it returned 
the allocated memory to user process. For example, kernel must zero the page
 or initialized the page for security reason. Please refer to linux device 
 driver page 9.
 
And when the user process use the high memory, it may invoke system call
with a pointer parameter pointing to the high memory. since the kernel is 
running in current 
process's context, it can access the high memory with user space's part of 
mapping. It will copy the content referred by the pointer to the kernel space. 
  
Q: why not let the clib zero the page or initialize it, it saves the kernel's 
effort and simplify the kernel.
A: besides Requesting memory through clib, user program can also  request 
memory through direct System call. In this situation,the security is not 
guranteed, the information in memory will be leaked. For example, kernel 
provides the way to call new created system call, without clib involved.
