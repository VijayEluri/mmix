ove to green production techniques wherever possible.''

$\cdots$\smallskip

``And, so you can see that making a change happens pretty quickly.''

``So you have seen the factory floor, Let's head back to my office. We've got 
about half an hour before lunch, so maybe we can discuss the new order 
you mentioned.''

\beginsection 3. Explanation of the Dialogure. (4:20)\par
It sounds like Ingid has given quite a few tours 
and she is very knowledgeable aobut the processes carrying up.
She is familiar with various producion lines used to make and package GC 
cleaning products.
and knows all the equipment well.
You should be just prepared when you take someone on the tour of your factory, 

After Ingrid greet carl, she offers drink. this is formality to show hostility, 
and give visitors a moment to relax and recover from
the trip to the factory.


``Good to hear. Ah, before we get started, is there anything I can get you. 
water? coffee? or coca perhaps?''

In certain seasons, it may be appropriate to to take a person's coat. 
In other case, such as after long jouney. you might want to offer visitor 
a chance to fresh up, which is a polite way to offer visitor a bathroom.

Let's practice a few more way to Make offers.
\smallskip
1). ``May I offer you something?''\par
2). ``Would you like something to drink?''\par
3). ``Can I take your coat?''\par
4). ``Perhaps you'd like to fresh up before we start.''\par

\medskip
2. You are ready to begin.

 ``Shall we get started? Follow me, and we will head down to the factory floor.''
It's time to start the tour.

Ingrid first meaning they will go that direction.
YOu are ready to 
\smallskip
1). ``Please walk this way, I will start the tour.''\par
2). ``If you follow me, we can begin our tour.''\par
3). ``If you are ready, we can make our way now.''\par
4). ``we should get moving because there is a lot to see.''\par

\medskip
3. Once you got tour started,  such as ``above us'', ``below us'', where liquid
 detergent is produced.
 
``So, this is our main produciton area, and here, on the left, you can see 
the liquid detergent line.''

If you take a visitor on tour, you wil have to be familiar with many of 
this different way to indicate thing are located.
listen to the way the location of this parts of the factory are described.

\smallskip
1). ``Behind this door is the control room.''\par
2). ``Just ahead of us , you see the lab.''\par
3).`` After the right, you will find the warehousr''\par
3). ``Below us, is the power generator for the entire system.''\par
4). ``Just be on the workshop, is the quality control department.''\par
\smallskip

4. In general , during a tour, on certain areas 
interesting piece of equipment, 


``and it will be replaced before the end of the month here too.''

``Just over here we have a newest,state of the art piece of equipment. As you 
can see, it is a laser guided machine for environmentally sustainable packaging.''

Ingrid and Carl discuss this particular machine because it is state of the art, or 
features latest technology. It use laser for part of operation.
and produce pacakge that does not harm  environment, this is obviously someting 
interesting to both Carl and Ingrid and probably important to the company itself.


you may have to find out about specialized interest of your visitor or 
highlight something you think they should take a close look at.
here is some way to do this.

\smallskip
1). ``If you are interested, I can show tyou the lab.''\par
2). ``This, of course, is the highlight of the tour.''\par
3). ``Comming up is something I know you want to see.''\par
4). ``This area is the heart of th operations for all the simply work.''\par
5). ``Let me just draw your attention to the new produciton line we are 
setting up.''\par
\smallskip

\medskip
5.Visitor are likely to have quesitons even during an excellent tour such as
Ingrid. and it is imporant to acknowldge this and  not make
 visitor feel that they are interruptting you to ask quesitons.
As the tour progresses, It is a good idea to check if there is any quesiotns as 
Ingrid does here with Carl.



``Exactly. We are doing our best to follow company's CSR policy by switching 
over to green production techniques wherever possible. Have you any question
 before we move on?''

Ingrid and carl are discussing greeen or environmental issue, and Ingrid mentinos.
Companry's Corporate Social Responsibility or CSR policy. which encourge produciton
techique which will not harm the environment. Ingrid know here 
will be a move to other aread,  so he asked 
carl if he has any questions before they do so.

you can check to see whether your visitors have questions by using
 expressions like this.
\smallskip
1). ``Is everything clear?''\par
2). ``Fell free to ask quesiton whenever you like''\par
3). ``Would you like to know anything else?''\par
4). ``Perhaps you like to ask a quesiton or two?''\par
5). ``Let me know if there is anything you want to know more detail about?''\par
\smallskip


6.go on for too long if only you have work to do.
if only because you have other work to do?

``So now you have see the Factory floor, Let's head back to our office. we got about 
half an hour before lunch''
you need to signpost the 

1). ``That's the  end of the tour, so let's go back to office.''\par
2). ``we have jsut covered everyting we want to see. So how about some 
freshments?''\par
3). ``Well, we've just seen it all now, why don't we get back to the 
office?''\par
4). ``That is all about it for the tour. Would you like to get by to eat?''\par


\beginsection 4. Exercise and Practices. (12:50)\par

Now it's your turn to practice some of the language we've looked at today.
First let's review the language of Indicating locations. Imagining you are
take someone on the tour of the factory, you will hear question about place associated with 
the factory plus a location. make a statement that starts with the location given.

For Example, if you hear:  \par
``Where is the warehouse? On our right.''\par
You can say:\par
``On our right, you can see the warehourse.''\par
Are you ready? Let's give it a try.\par

\smallskip
1). Where is the loading area? At the west end of the factory.\par
2). Where is the control room? Behind this door.\par
3). Where is the lab? To the right.\par
4). Where is the inspection point for this line? Just ahead.\par
\smallskip

Now let's listen to some example answers.\par
\smallskip
1). Where is the loading area?\par
Answer: At the west end of the factory, we will find the loading area.\par

2). Where is the control room? \par
Answer: Behind this door is the control room.\par

3). Where is the lab?\par
Answer: To the right, you can see the lab.\par

4). Where is the inspection point for this line? Just ahead.\par
Answer: Just ahead is the inspection point for this line. \par

\medskip
(15:00)Now we will review some of vocabulary from this episode.
You will hear a series of sendtences with the word replaced with the beep.
Repeat the whole setense saying the missin words. For example, if you hear:\par
``we stay on cutting ???? through continuous improvement.''\par
You can say:\par
``we stay on cutting edge through continuous improvement.''\par
After each response, we will play the correct answer. Let's begin.\par

\smallskip
I am afraid we have to shut down the production ???? for an hour.\par
I am afraid we have to shut down the production line for an hour.
\smallskip
We ?????? out that equipment last year as it kept breaking down.\par
