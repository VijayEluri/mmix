Thanks for your contact.

I have applied leave twice this week. It is not 
convenient for me to apply leave again next week.
Is it possible to schedule the interview in the week 
after next week, e.g. July 22.

If possilbe, please let me know the detail information 
of the new position.

Would you mind if I call you sometime next Monday?
