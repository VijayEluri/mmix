When I worked with American Customer, I learned the following accronym.
	CT: Central Timezone
	CST: Central Standard Timezone
	CDT: Central Daylight Saving Timezone
	
When I install Gentoo, I choose PRC(People's Repuboic of China) timezone, but I see
CST in output of date command and feel it is confusing.	Today I learn that CST also stands
for China Standard Time. China v.s. Central, which is which?
