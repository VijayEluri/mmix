After two weeks' struggle,  I have successfully installed Gentoo, a popular GNU/Linux Distribution. For Records, the obstacles I encountered are listed below.
(but I can not remember the solution exactly)
0. failed to emerge gpm when I install the links package.
If I recall correctly, it is resolved by install gpm manually. 

1.I encounter issue when I install glib 2.22.5. 
	no update-desktop-database.
which is in dev-util/desktop-file-utils. When I try to emerge it, there is a circular dependency on glib. no solution
and I forget How I resolve the problem.

2. later after I install glib, with ~amd64 keyword I can install gpm-1.20.6, but it conflicts with the manually inatalled gpm. 
I remove the conflicted file and emerge successfully.

3. Failed to emerge tiff. 
edit packages.keywords to add the following.
	<category>/<package> ~amd64
I am able to use latest tiff in beta-version, which is unstable and masked out.


4. later atk-1.28.0 failed to emerge.
edit /etc/make.conf with the following.
 FEATURES="-stricter". 
then emerge successfully with only some complain. with out this seting. the warining from GCC will cause that emerge fail.

5 when I run 
	emerge --update system
actually gcc will be upgraded from 4.3.4 to 4.4.3. but it failed because of compilation warning, again. add "-stricter" into Features variable in /etc/make.conf work around it.

continue kde installation.

install Xorg


1. enable edev in kernel if not yet.
Device Drivers --->
  Input device support --->
  <*>  Event interface

check result: already selected.

2. update make.config

(For mouse, keyboard, and Synaptics touchpad support)
INPUT_DEVICES="evdev synaptics"
(OR, for ATI Radeon cards)
VIDEO_CARDS="radeon"
#fglrx is propritary one

emerge -pv xorg-server, check all the options available and choose those which apply to your system.


emerge xorg-server

# env-update
# source /etc/profile


# /etc/init.d/hald start
# rc-update add hald default

startx

those two package will test X.
emerge --unmerge twm xterm 
emerge --unmerge twm xterm 



3D accelaration:
Binary drivers include 
	x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers  for nVidia cards and 
*	x11-drivers/ati-drivers for ATI cards. 
	
	
	
emerge is the wrapper layer of common practice, such as autoconfig.
when we manually intall a package, usually we can customize it with parameters
to ./configure. Note that ./configure in each package have the same name but different ocntent.

those parameters are wrapped by the USE flag. the /etc/make.conf is the system level setting, package private setting is in /etc/protage/package.use. this effect of the setting can be viewed with emerge -pv <package>
example 
	x11-base/xfree -ipv6
	app-misc/mc -X gpm

etcat -u package.
