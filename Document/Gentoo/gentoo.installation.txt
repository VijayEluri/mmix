emerge is the wrapper layer of common practice, such as autoconfig.
when we manually intall a package, usually we can customize it with parameters
to ./configure. Note that ./configure in each package have the same name but different ocntent.

those parameters are wrapped by the USE flag. the /etc/make.conf is the system level setting, package private setting is in /etc/protage/package.use. this effect of the setting can be viewed with emerge -pv <package>
example 
	x11-base/xfree -ipv6
	app-misc/mc -X gpm
