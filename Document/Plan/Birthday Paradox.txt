Today I resolved the following problem independantly.

%\beginsection 1. Problem description.\par
For a group of n people, what is the probability of at least two people having same 
birthday.

$$1 - {365!\over(365-n)!*365^n}$$
   
{\bf Note:} (1)$365!/(365-n)!$ is equal to $365*364*\cdots*(365-n+1)$. (2) this 
problem is popularly knowns as Birthday Paradox.

{\bf Explaination:}
Consider we only have 365 day in a year, each person may have 365 possible 
birthday. The possibility all of them have different birthday is 
$$ 365!\over(365-n)!*365^n$$  
$365^n$ is the total combination, and $365!/(365-n)!$ is the combination
each person have different birthday.
 
If we consider leap year have 366 day, than the problem become more complex.
 %averagely,
because the possiblity of Feb. 29 birthday is lower than normal days.
 
If we consider the probability of exact two people having same birthday.  it is
$$C_n^2 * {365!\over(365-n+1)!*365^n}$$  

similarly we can get the possibility of exact $k$ people having same birthday. 
it is
$$C_n^k * {365!\over(365-n+(k-1))!*365^n}$$ 

so we can get the possiblity of at leat two people by sum the possiblity of $2, 3,  
\cdots n$ people having same birthday.
$$\sum_{k=2}^n C_n^k * {365!\over(365-n+(k-1))!*365^n}$$

To see whether our guess is correct. we multiply $365^n$ on both formulas. now we need
to compare $365^n-365*364*\cdots*(365-n+1)$ and 
$\sum_{k=2}^n C_n^k * 365*364*\cdots*(365-n+k-1)$

it show this conjecture is wrong when $n\beq 4$, I spend many time to find out
why it is not correct because of blind point in my mind. After I figure it out
it is easy to understand with a simple example when $n=4$.
for k=2, we only consider that 2 of people have same birthday and another two have
different birthday. but we did not consider that another two may also have same birthday.
so we loss some cases when summing.
