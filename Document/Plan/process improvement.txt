1. UT/IT is done by developer in implementation phase.
a. Author can not be reviewer and UTer, ITer. that means usually
there are at least three developers who know the detail of a task.
(Good way to ensure the knowledge sharing.)

b. Track the process with the execution log.
c. Tester also get involved when they choose the cases for Integration test.

Need to convert Developer's attitude. Through testing.

currently, only tester themself can not ensure the quality.
Developer have to do UT/IT to ensure we have enough resource on testing.
(In current model, only test can ensure the quality)

2. To reveal the capability of the group.

we have enhanced code review, it can majorly to prevent silly mistake,
but can not contribute too much on detecting UI/Functional defects.
 
3. how about QA review/Release and Test Leader review.
