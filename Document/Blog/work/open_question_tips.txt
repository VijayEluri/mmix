Should we ask customer open question? The short answer is NO.

Since "open question document" is an important document in ODC, you may think 
we are always asking open question and disagree with me.

First,let me explain what open question is.

closed question v.s. open question.
A closed question can be answered with either a single word or a short phrase.

An open question is likely to receive a long answer.

should we ask open question or close question?

open question:
Advantages:
You may got some extra important information which you never imagine.

Disadvantages:
Customer need to spend figure out how to deal with it. To some extent, you push 
the problem to him.

If the question is related to technique, customer may need many time to understand the 
question and context, they may even raise question about the technical details 
before they answer the question.


close question:
Advantages:
Customer only need to make a choice based on his perspective or his personal preference.
(To some extent, we just want to know customer's preference)

Disadvantages:
We need spend more effort to develop the solution since we are taking more responsibility.
