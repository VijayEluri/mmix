There are two ways to install subversion.
1. Source Code.
2. Binary Package.

Since compile from source code is more complex, subversion also depends on 
APR (Apache Public Runtime). I decided to use Binary package.

I am using Fedora, it's quite simple, just type

	{\tt yum install subversion}

I use Ubuntu in home, so I should type

	{\tt apt-get install subversion}

I have tried the following commands.

	{\tt svn checkout https://mmix.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mmix \}
	{\tt --username eddie.wjf}
	{\tt tW8bQ2Wh5EW9}

Then I can check in code for quick sort.
