\beginsetion 1. WYSIWYM vs WYSIWYG.

WYSIWYM stands for What You See is What You Mean; 
WYSIWYG stands for What You See is What You Get;

Microsoft---Word is always considered as a example of WYSIWYG. 
Today I have a look at the tool named LyX, which is an example of 
WYSIWYM. From an end user's point of view, there are more similarity 
than difference between them. 

They both display the the resulted layout on the fly; they both provide 
button to typeset the document.

The difference I can see between then is -- LyX use text file, while Word 
use binary file. But I don't think it matters.

In my humble opinion, the real difference between Word and LyX/LaTeX is 
as the following. In Word, you typeset in the lower level, you can control 
all the details but it also need more effort. In LyX/LaTex, you typeset in 
higher level, you only need to figure out the logic structure of the document. 
The resulted layout is not decided by you, you actually just share the layout 
developed by the expert. I think it is the key advantage of WYSIWYM.
