YOu may need to google it.

2. install cscope and vi.

3. refer to http://cscope.sourceforge.net/large_projects.html for the following steps.

It will include all the source code of the whole OS, not only the kernel.

we actually only care kernel source.
find src/sys -name '*.[ch]' > cscope.files

4.  wc cscope.files 
 1613  1613 45585 cscope.files

5. vim
:help cscope
then you can read the help details.

6. if you run vim in the folder where cscope.out resides. then it will be loaded
automaically. 

7. Try a few commands.
:cs find g mbuf
:cs find f vm.h

They works. A good start.
