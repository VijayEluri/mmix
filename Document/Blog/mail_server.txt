Yesterday, we found that the application can not send mail successfully, I suspect it caused by that the mail server host name can not be resolved in the application server.

execute the following command
host <mail server host name>
It 

man host 
It tell me to resort to /etc/resolv.conf 
open it with 
vi /etc/resolv.conf 
nameserver <name server 1>
nameserver <name server 2>
update the config with correct DNS server IP.

Everything is OK.
