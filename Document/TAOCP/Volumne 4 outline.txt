Volume 4

Combinatorial Algorithms, in preparation. (Some parts are already available; see below.)
Present plans are to publish ``Volume 4'' as at least three separate subvolumes:

    * Volume 4A, Enumeration and Backtracking
          o 7. Introduction
          
          o 7.1. Zeros and ones
          o 7.1.1. Boolean basics
          o 7.1.2. Boolean evaluation
          o 7.1.3. Bitwise tricks and techniques
          o 7.1.4. Binary decision diagrams
          
          o 7.2. Generating all possibilities
          o 7.2.1. Combinatorial generators
          o 7.2.2. Basic backtrack
          o 7.2.3. Efficient backtracking
          
          o 7.3. Shortest paths
          
    * Volume 4B, Graph and Network Algorithms
          o 7.4. Graph algorithms
          o 7.4.1. Components and traversal
          o 7.4.2. Special classes of graphs
          o 7.4.3. Expander graphs
          o 7.4.4. Random graphs
          
          o 7.5. Network algorithms
          o 7.5.1. Distinct representatives
          o 7.5.2. The assignment problem
          o 7.5.3. Network flows
          o 7.5.4. Optimum subtrees

          o 7.5.6. Optimum orderings
          
          o 7.6. Independence theory
          o 7.6.1. Independence structures
          o 7.6.2. Efficient matroid algorithms
          
    * Volume 4C and possibly 4D, Optimization and Recursion
          o 7.7. Discrete dynamic programming
          o 7.8. Branch-and-bound techniques
          o 7.9. Herculean tasks (aka NP-hard problems)
          o 7.10. Near-optimization
          
          o 8. Recursion

The material will first appear in beta-test form as fascicles of approximately 
128 pages each, issued approximately twice per year. These fascicles will 
represent my best attempt to write a comprehensive account, but computer 
science has grown to the point where I cannot hope to be an authority on all 
the material covered in these books. Therefore I'll need feedback from readers 
in order to prepare the official volumes later.

Volume 4 Fascicle 0, Introduction to Combinatorial Algorithms and 
Boolean Functions (2008), xii+216pp. ISBN 0-321-53496-4
Volume 4 Fascicle 2, Generating All Tuples and Permutations 
(2005), v+128pp. ISBN 0-201-85393-0
Volume 4 Fascicle 3, Generating All Combinations and Partitions 
(2005), vi+150pp. ISBN 0-201-85394-9
Volume 4 Fascicle 4, Generating All Trees; History of Combinationatorial Generation 
(2006), vi+120pp. ISBN 0-321-33570-8
Some "pre-fascicles" are also available for alpha-testing: 
Pre-Fascicle 1a (Bitwise tricks and techniques); 
Pre-Fascicle 1b (Binary Decision Diagrams). 
I've put them online primarily so that experts in the field can check the 
contents before I inflict them on a wider audience. But if you want to help 
debug them, please go right ahead.
