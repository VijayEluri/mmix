1. my answer is x = x ^ (x & m) ^( y & m)
				y = y ^ (x & m) ^ (y & m)
				
it can be verified by the truth table
original x=1,y=1; resulted x=1, y=1
original x=0,y=0; resulted x=0, y=0
original x=0,y=1; resulted x=m, y=!m
original x=1,y=0; resulted x=!m, y=m

The net effect is: if m = 0, keep x, y unchanged.
				   if m = 1, exchange x and y.	

lessons learned is that: in the six combination between |, &, ^. only three of
them satisfy the distribution law. 
(x op1 y) op2 z = (x op2 z) op1 (y op1 z)

op1 = &; op2 = |;
op1 = |; op2 = &;
op1 = ^; op2 = &;	

2. my answer is that: three statements are all true!
the third one is a little hard. we suppose that x > y, without consider lending.
the result are same, but left part need to subtract the value corresponding to
lending bit.	

3. X(CN) = X(NC) + 1
