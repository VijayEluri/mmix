Permutation is important, usually the permutation is the space for complete 
searching.

The first point is how to generate all the permutaitons quickly. Manay 
techniques are revised. 

The second point is actually only a few of the permuation are valid result. In 
the terms of finding the valid result as quick as possible, different scheme of 
iterating the 
problem space may have completely different Efficiency (performance).

N elements have N! kinds of permutations. There are (N!)! kinds of ways to 
transverse them. only a few of (N!)! ways are considered to have special 
properties and deserve the attention.

isomorphism: only the label are diffrent, but actually the structure is 
equivalent with each other.
There is a one to one mapping. u <--> u', v <--> v' so that 
u --- v if and only u' --- v' 
we can either label them as 1,2,3 or 0,1,2.

There are n! isomorphism for graph of order n. each of them may or may not have
a different(unique) adjacent matrix.

The equivalent one caused by different ways of drawing/labeling is  called 
isomorphism.

automorphism is different with isomorphism.
The symmetries of a graph, also known as its automorhpism, are the permutations
of its vertices that preserve adjacency. The automorphism means that the 
isomorphism which have the same adjacent matrix.
