(Shortest) Depth of f will impact the parallelism.
(Shortest) Cost of f will impact the steps needed to evaluate.
(Shortest) Length of f just tell you the shortest formula. it can not ensure
 the
(Shortest) Cost.

There is a complement function for each one. and they share the same Depth, 
Cost, and Length;
so we only need consider half of them.

same class should have same C(f), D(f), L(f).
