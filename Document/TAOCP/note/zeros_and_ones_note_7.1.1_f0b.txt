monotone function
<==>
when variable change from 0 to 1, the result will not change from 1 to 0.
<==>
F(x) <= F(y) when xi <= yi;
<==> 
f is constant or can be expressed entirely in OR and AND, without complementation.


disjunctive normal form
(there may be implicit implicant in the expression!)
Say there are c 1s in the truth table of m variable boolean expression, the length
of the expression is (2*m-1)*t + (t-1) = 2mt-1 
		may LONGER THAN
disjunctive prime form
(only have prime implicant, itself can not be simplified)
		may LONGER THAN
shortest disjuctive nomal form
(we may cover all the necessay point with only a few of the maximal subcubes.

e.g.
F(x,y,z)
The truth table is 00110101.
{010,011,101,111}
000	0
001	0
010	1
011	1
100	0
101	1
110	0
111	1

F(x,y,z) = (x & (!y) & z) | (y & z) | ((!x) & y & (!z))
{101,*11,010}


From truth table, the candidate is
{*11, 1*1, 01*} we need to choose from them and ensure all the point are covered.
so the disjection prime form is 
F(x,y,z) = (x & z) | (y & z) | ((!x) & y)
{1*1,*11,01*}

The better is:
01*,1*1 (it can cover all the point)
F(x,y,z) = (((!x) & y) | (x & z)

for fomula 30, it is in prime form, but is the shortest one.

The algorithm to find it NP-Complete.



for S2:
00010111

000	0
001	0
010	0
011	1
100	0
101	1
110	1
111	1

{11*,1*1,*11}
(x&y)|(z&z)|(y&z)
finally get the point: the shortest disjuction form is composed of prime implicant.
if any one of the prime implicant are not in the shortest disjunctionform


How to know whether the function is monotone given the truth table.
or how to get the variable sequence as the following for 3 variable function:
000 001 010 100 011 101 110 111
1  3 3 1
4 variable
0000 0001 0010 0100 1000 0011 0101 0110 1001 1010 1100 0111 1011 1101 1110 1111
1	4 6 4 1

canalizing	


Threshold -/-> Symmetric
if the weight is different, then it is not symmetric.

Symmetric -/-> Threshold
e.g. S2,4 is not Threshold.
it can be expressed in Threshold of Threshold though.

Monotone -/-> Threshold 
Threshold -/-> Monotone


Pure Threshold --> Symmetric
Pure Threshold --> Monotone







for self-dual, the result is 
i=0: 0 of 2 is self-dual
i=1: 2 of 4 is self-dual
i=2: 4 of 16 is self-dual
i=3: 16 of 256 is self-dual
i=4: 256 of 65536 is self-dual
i=5: 65536 of 4294967296 is self-dual

a. case for i=5 takes about half an hour.
b. the result are the power of 2, it should be proved by mathmetics instead of
brute force calculation. 
e.g. n=3.
the length of truth table is 8. left half of them are of length 4 and have
16 different value. for each of them, only one of the 16 value in right half can 
satisfy the self dual criteria.
in general the count of self dual function of n variable is power(2, power(2,n-1)).




For symmetric. e.g. n=3.
the truth table is sorted as the following.
{000,{001,010,100},{011,101,110},111}
each group has 0,1,2,3 ones. in order to be symmetric, each group should have same 
value. for each group, the value can be true or false, so there are power(2,4) cases.
in general, power(2,n+1)

For monotone
i=0: 2 of 2 is monotone
i=1: 3 of 4 is monotone
i=2: 6 of 16 is monotone
i=3: 20 of 256 is monotone
i=4: 168 of 65536 is monotone
i=5: 

For threshold, it is a little hard.
it depends on that whether we can find suitable weight for the inequal formula.
Wrong: Threshold function is self dual and monotone
Threshold function can be expressed in medial funciton, but with constant.

The rule is that if the fuciton is formed entirely with median function without any constant.
it is monotone and self-dual. 


let's consider pure threshold function first.
e.g. 3
there are 5 function.
vx>=0,1,2,3,4
