page 3:
(Shortest) Depth of f will impact the parallelism.
(Shortest) Cost of f will impact the steps needed to evaluate.
(Shortest) Length of f just tell you the shortest formula. it can not ensure 
the (Shortest) Cost.

There is a complement function for each one. and they share the same Depth, 
Cost, and Length;
so we only need consider half of them.

same class should have same C(f), D(f), L(f).

what is B(f).
may be it just mean the size of BDD diagram.

Yeah, in the index, it says "B(f): size of its BDD".

for I_s representation. it corresponds to the arch in the BDD. (Complete Wrong)


The size of BDD is the number of Nodes (Vertices) in the BDD.
