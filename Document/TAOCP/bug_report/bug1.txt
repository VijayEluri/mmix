Title:
Reporting one bug on Page 31 of Volume 4 Fascicle 1a - Section 7.1.3 

Hi There,

In the formula 129 on Page 31 of Volume 4 Fascicle 1a, the Boolean expression for "x implication y" is not correct since it does not match the truth table defined in formula 127 in the same page.

The truth table for "x implication y" defined in formula 127 is as the following:
11  11  11
01  11  11
00  01  11


But the truth table for "x implication y" we get from formula 129 is as the following:
00  00  00
10  00  00
11  00  00

In my opinion, to match the truth table defined in formula 127, the Boolean expression for "x implication y" in formula 129 should be changed as the following.
    For left bit of "x implication y", the formula should be: (!(xr^yl)|(!xl)&yr);
    For right bit of "x implication y", the formula should be: (!xl)|(yr)    

Please kindly review it and let me know if it is a real bug.

Regards,
Eddie Wu
