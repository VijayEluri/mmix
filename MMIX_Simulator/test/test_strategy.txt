To test the instruction implementation, 100% coverage is impossible because of
combinational explosion. My idea is to use random number to generate random case
to test it.

For most instruciton, I already implemented it. Now majoy piece left is the 
Floating point instruciton, I plan to just port it from C to Java. If time permitted
I will also try to use java library, such as BigInteger to reimplement it.
