NOV. 12 - 2008 Wednesday.
Today, fixed one bug and Copy.mmo can pass.

I am thinking about how to implement NNIX as the operation System for MMIX while MMIX hardware is not available.

User Mode Linux may provide some thought on this.

Current MMIX Simulator actually is not only a simulator for MMIX hardware, but also partially a simulator for a rudimentary
operating system. e.g. the I/O was implemented in this way. when user program trap to operating system through TRAP
instruction, it's operating system 's responsibility to accomplish the job and execute RESUME instruction to return
to user program. I am wondering how will the NNIX looks like if we can develop
it.

so we may need to develop a simulator for NNIX first before we can develop NNIX.

we can first ignore the details of POST of MMIX machine, and let the Simulator to setup the environment for NNIX.
The NNIX start to execute his initialization and open a shell to execute MMIX program.

Next step we may consider how to load the NNIX image to the memory.

What NNIX need to do:
1. manage the resource
2. implement all the system calls.

if the NNIX have to run on the Simulator, then we need to code it in some high level language, such as C, and 
compile it into MMIX instructions. and execute it in simulator.
to make the NNIX a multi-task OS, we need to mimic a Shell.
It sounds to me that the task is too huge to git it done.
So can we migrate current program in C to MMIX platform.
GCC already support MMIX, so what is the linkage convention used for MMIX?
