I want to tell you something about my Grandmother’s home. 
There is a big yard. Grandma raised several pigs, a dozen chickens, a dog and an Ox. There are several fruit trees in the yards, including persimmon and megranate. 

My grandma also owns a forest of bamboo. I like both bamboo and bamboo shoot. Last May, I went back to hometown and I collected the bamboo shoot with my dad and mum, it is so funny.

In Spring Festival, I had the opportunity to make snowman together with grandpa and grandma; Carrot becomes snowman’s nose, Wood charcoal becomes snowman’s eyes, Residue of firework becomes snowman’s month. Is it funny? 

再来说说奶奶家，我很喜欢去奶奶家。奶奶家有很大的院子，爷爷养了一头牛（爷爷还要在县城里打工，家里是奶奶一个人管理的），奶奶养了好几头猪，还有一群鸡，院子里还种了几棵果树，秋天到奶奶家可以采柿子和石榴，我和妈妈总是把最熟的采下了就吃，好甜啊；奶奶家还有菜园，奶奶种了各种蔬菜；奶奶家还有竹林，我最喜欢的就是去拔笋，去年我和妈妈、爸爸、奶奶去拔笋，拔了好多好多，我可开心了。春节在奶奶家，下了雪，爷爷帮我一起在院子里堆了个雪人，胡萝卜做鼻子，黑炭做眼睛，焰火红色包装纸做嘴巴，爷爷奶奶还用稻草做头发。你说有意思吧！
