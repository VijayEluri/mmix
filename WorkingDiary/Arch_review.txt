1. The usage of Sequence4KeyGeneration
	Why not use Sequence in Oracle database? does IMDB support the concept of Sequence.


2. There is no index at all except the default index on primary key.

3. Bad DAO implementation. some API use Object Pojo as input parameter, but only need a ID. it cause unnecessary Object creation and database hit.
